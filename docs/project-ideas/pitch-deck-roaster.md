## Sample Roast Output

```
üî• PITCH DECK ROAST REPORT üî•
Overall Score: 3.2/10 (Wouldn't get a meeting)

SLIDE-BY-SLIDE DESTRUCTION:

Slide 1 - Title
‚ùå "Uber for X" - Instant eye roll. VCs see 50 of these daily.
FIX: Lead with the problem, not a tired comparison.

Slide 3 - Problem
‚ùå Not a real problem. "People want easier X" isn't a $1B problem.
FIX: Find actual data showing pain, not assumptions.

Slide 5 - Solution
‚ùå Your solution is a feature, not a company.
FIX: Explain the 10x improvement, not incremental change.

Slide 8 - Market Size
‚ùå TAM/SAM/SOM pyramid = amateur hour.
FIX: Show bottom-up calculation with real customer data.

Slide 11 - Competition
‚ùå Quadrant showing you in top-right = everyone does this.
FIX: Explain your actual moat, not made-up axes.

Slide 14 - Team
‚ùå "Serial entrepreneur" = failed before.
FIX: Show specific relevant expertise or traction.

HARSH TRUTH:
This deck screams "first-time founder with no customers."
You're solving a vitamin problem with no unique insight.
A VC would delete this email in 8 seconds.

WHAT WOULD MAKE VCs INTERESTED:
1. Show 10x traction (users/revenue)
2. Demonstrate unique insight
3. Prove you can execute
4. Find a real problem worth solving
```

## Key Differentiators

1. **Brutal Honesty**: What VCs really think
2. **Specific Fixes**: Not generic advice
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Learned from thousands
4. **Instant Results**: No waiting for coaches
